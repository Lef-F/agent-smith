Dedicated to the Deal: Our only incentive is helping you land a great deal, so we don't accept any sponsored links or advertising content in our deal alerts.

Essential travel info:

Flight changes: When an airline offers a flexible change or cancellation policy, we'll note that here. Most airlines do charge a fee for making changes or cancelling a flight now.

Entry Requirements: You can enter most countries normally with proof of vaccination - Skyscanner has a useful tool for double-checking requirements. Some countries do have extra testing or quarantine rules to enter if you're unvaccinated.

How to book it

Step1
We recommend Google Flights to find this deal because it has an easy-to-use calendar tool to browse dates and fares. See an example itinerary by pressing the blue button below.

Select one of the date boxes to expand the calendar view and see fares for each departure date. The fares shown will update if you pick a longer or shorter trip - trying different lengths can reveal more options.

You can find the cheapest fares with an Online Travel Agent in step two, or book with the airline once you select both flights on Google Flights.

When to use online travel agents

Step2
To get the lowest fares (listed above), book with an Online Travel Agent (OTA). Skyscanner lists OTAs that are the cheapest for this deal - see an example through the blue button below.

On Skyscanner, enter the itinerary you found in step one and wait for the search to finish loading - it can take 20-30 seconds. Book with the cheapest OTA or the one you like the most.

Quickly convert your Google Flights finds to searches on Skyscanner with our Fare Compare browser extension. One click and you're done :-)
